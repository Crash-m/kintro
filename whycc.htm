<h1 class="centered">Why This License?</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a>
organization has developed licenses that, as their
website puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...will help you tell others that your works are free
for copying and other uses&#8212;but only on certain conditions.
You&#8217;re probably familiar with the phrase &#8220;All rights reserved&#8221;
and the little &copy; that goes along with it. Creative Commons wants to
help copyright holders send a different message: &#8220;Some rights reserved.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I still do own the copyright on this tutorial, there are
some rights which I wish others to have. What follows has been
adapted from <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">the
Creative Commons page</a>, and I&#8217;ve expanded it to give
my reasons for my choices. You may also
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode">see
the full license</a>.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Attribution</dt>
<dd>
    <p>You  may copy, distribute, display, and perform the work.
    In return, you must give the original author credit.
    I chose this option because I put a lot of work into the
    tutorial, I am proud of it, and I want others to know
    whose work it is.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Noncommercial</dt>
<dd>
    <p>You may copy, distribute, display, and perform the work. In return,you may
    not use the work for commercial purposes&#8212;unless you get my permission. 
    As you may have detected from the preceding text, I&#8217;m in this for the
    ego, not for the money. Also, I have used many Open Source and
    Free Software tools to help me create this site.  I got those
    tools for free; by keeping this site free of monetary charges,
    I feel I am giving back to that community.</p>
</dd>

<dt>No Derivative Works</dt>
<dd>
    <p>You may copy, distribute, display and perform only unaltered
    copies of this site&#8212;not derivative works based on it.
    This is where I am parting company with the true &#8220;Free
    Software&#8221; folks.   In most Open Source / Free Software
    licenses (one of which
    I used for the older version of this tutorial), you have
    the right to modify the tutorial as you please, as long as
    those modifications are freely shared with others on an
    equal basis.</p>
    
    <p>I would have loved to use this option, but a previous
    bad experience dissuaded me from doing so.  A couple of years
    ago, I did a search for &#8220;Korean tutorial&#8221; on the
    web and found one at the
    <a href="http://www.unification.org">Unification Church</a>
    website.  This is the church run by the Reverend Sun Myung
    Moon, whom I consider to be a dangerous lunatic.  I decided to take a look,
    and, lo and behold, there was my tutorial, copied in full
    (without ever getting my permission!). Copied in full, that is, 
    <em><strong>except</strong></em> for the index page, where the
    text had been altered to make it look as though I had written
    the tutorial expressly for them.  I emailed them and told them
    that I was not happy with their change, and they were kind enough
    to add wording to make it clear that I was not affiliated with
    their church, and had not written the tutorial for them.</p>
    
    <p>That&#8217;s the reason that I chose the &#8220;no derivative
    works&#8221; option.  I have no objection to people copying
    and distributing the tutorial, but I do not want them to put
    words into my mouth.</p>
    
    <p>This also means that if you find any bugs or any mistakes in
    the tutorial, you can&#8217;t correct them yourself and
    redistribute the tutorial. You can, however, contact me and let
    me know about the errors so that I can fix them; I&#8217;d
    appreciate that.</p>

    <p>Choosing the &#8220;no derivative works&#8221; option was not
    an easy decision, but I finally decided that I wanted the protection
    that this option offers. To those folks who are strong
    proponents of Free Software, I know you are disappointed,
    and I&#8217;m sorry.</p>
