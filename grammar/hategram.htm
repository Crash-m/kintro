<h1 class="centered">Grammar? I <b>Hate</b> Grammar!</h1>

<p><a href="../index.htm">Return to main index</a></p>
<p>Here are the main reasons why people hate grammar:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grammar just slows me down - if I have to figure out the rules it will take
me ten minutes to say five words.</li>
<li>Children learn to speak a language before they can read a grammar book.</li>
<li>As long as people understand me, that&#8217;s all that counts.</li>
<li>Grammar is boring and doesn&#8217;t make any sense, anyway.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let&#8217;s address these points one by one. </p>

<h2>Grammar Slows Me Down</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s some truth to this first objection. There are times
that you don&#8217;t want any grammar. If you&#8217;re doing “hit and
run” language learning&#8212;learning enough of a language to feel
comfortable as a tourist, grammar will definitely slow you down. You
want to use the “listen and repeat” method to learn those <a
href="../bphrases/preface.htm">vital polite phrases</a>. This method
can bring you to a respectable conversational level as well. The folks
at <a href="http://www.berlitz.com">Berlitz</a> have shown that,
given time and enough exposure to a language, you can get some very
impressive results.</p>

<h2>Children Don&#8217;t Need Formal Grammar to Learn a Language</h2>
<p>That&#8217;s correct. Children are the ultimate
&#8220;listen-and-repeat&#8221; learners. However, you aren&#8217;t
five years old any more. Learning a language as a child is very
different from learning a second language after your first language has
become &#8220;burned in.&#8221; At that stage in your life, grammar, if
presented properly, becomes a terrific learning tool.
