<h1 class="centered">Grammar? I <b>Hate</b> Grammar! (part 2)</h1>

<h2>As Long As People Understand Me, That's All That Counts</h2>
<p>This am, to an extent large, truly. You may has to look at these paragraph
a long times to figure what it am about out, but meaning across will come.
Writing or speaking like this am
the mark of a person whose is not good educated, and it am tough on the listener or
reader. For long-time fans of
<a href="http://www.dccomics.com/">Superman<small><sup>TM</sup></small> comics</a>, it is also a mark that you
have come from the Bizarro world.</p>

<h2>Grammar is Boring and Doesn&#8217;t Make Any Sense</h2>
<p>
I&#8217;m not surprised you feel this way. First, English grammar is mostly a set of exceptions
held together by spit and baling wire. Second, many authors of foreign language textbooks
come from a linguistics background (which can seem like the Bizarro world to most
of us!), and will use phrases like &#8220;introductory
conjunctive ending&#8221; and sentences like this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<cite>
The two past transferentives are followed by alternatives, which are mostly
contrastives.
</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>
They have not abandoned plain language in order to confuse you;
they&#8217;ve just gone
overboard in an attempt to be precise about the concepts they are
teaching. These linguists would tell you that the main reason grammar is so
great is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="big">
Knowledge of surface structure assists in determining the method of production
of one&#8217;s utterances.
</p>
</blockquote>
