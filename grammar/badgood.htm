<h1 class="centered">Grammar: Bad News / Good News</h1>

<p>I really urge you to look at the grammar section if you&#8217;re interested in
learning Korean in any real depth.  In the interests of full disclosure,
here&#8217;s what you&#8217;re getting into:</p>

<table class="bordered-table" style="width:75%">
<tr><th>The Bad News</th><th>The Good News</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>You&#8217;ll slow down at first as you remember the rules and paste together
sentences. (This will seem painfully slow to you. A delay of one second in getting a word
out feels like three weeks. <a href="listen.htm"><i>See note</i></a>)</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>As you practice (that&#8217;s the key: practice), you&#8217;ll be able to apply the rules more
quickly. Eventually the rules become automatic and you won&#8217;t have to pause to
figure them out.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>You&#8217;re given the rules for constructing sentences rather than "owning" them
by figuring them out for yourself.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>It&#8217;s a lot faster to have the rules figured out in advance. Anyway, you can still
construct your own personal rules if you don&#8217;t like the ones we give you.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>You&#8217;ll see some technical grammar terms in an effort to be precise.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>I promise to define the terms in plain language. You&#8217;ll get precise terms rather
than sloppy ones.</p>
</td>
</tr>
