<h1 class="centered">Listening to Beginners</h1>


<p>At some point you may be talking to someone who is beginning to learn English
and trying out a new sentence using newly-learned grammar rules.
He or she will also be experiencing the painful
slowness of saying a sentence one or two words at a time.
Here&#8217;s a good way to handle such a situation:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Do not say a single word until the other person
finishes!</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Nod your head slightly after each set of words&#8212;whether
they are right or wrong. The speaker will take this as a cue to
continue.</p>

<p>The speaker may ask, &#8220;Is that right?&#8221; in the middle of
the sentence. If it is, nod your head and make a &#8220;go ahead&#8221;
gesture with your hand. If it&#8217;s not, just make the &#8220;go
ahead&#8221; gesture and nod very very slightly. The speaker
doesn&#8217;t know it, but this is the worst possible time to provide
verbal feedback&#8212;especially negative feedback. The goal is to have
the speaker finish the sentence.</p></li>

<li><p>If the sentence was right, tell the speaker it was right. If it
was wrong, <strong>don&#8217;t say it was wrong</strong>. In both
cases, repeat the sentence (or its idea) to model it in correct
English. This provides reinforcement for correct sentences and
correction for incorrect sentences.  It also lets the speaker know that
you understood the meaning of the sentence. Examples:</p>

<p class="indented">
Speaker: My friend owns a restaurant.<br />
You: Yes, that's right. Your friend owns a restaurant.
</p>

<p class="indented">
Speaker: He buy book yesterday.<br />
You: He bought a book yesterday.
</p>
