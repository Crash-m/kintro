<h1 class="centered">Knowing Grammar Helps You Figure Out Why Your Sentences Work</h1>

<p>
One of the drawbacks of the listen-and-repeat method is that you learn sentence patterns
without explicitly learning how the patterns have been constructed.  You may, for
example, learn these sentences:
</p>

<p class="indented">
What is this? It is a pencil. <br />
What are these? These are pencils.<br />
What is this? It is a book.<br />
What are these? These are books<br />
</p>

<p>You are pretty much left on your own to figure out the rule that an
&#8220;s&#8221; at the end
of a word signifies plural, and why the plural of &#8220;this&#8221;
is &#8220;these.&#8221;</p>

<p>This approach does work, and has the advantage that you will figure
out a rule on your own. It is <em>your</em> rule, you own it, and
you&#8217;re unlikely to forget it.</p>

<p>The problem is that certain rules are tricky to discover. Russian
singular nouns, for instance, have five different endings depending on
how they&#8217;re used in a sentence. Determining the rules for
adjectives in Russian is a nightmare. However, a grammar book can tell
you what the rules are and reduce three sets of five endings to one set
and two simple spelling rules.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what grammar provides you with&#8212;the set of rules
that assists you in figuring out why the sentences you&#8217;ve learned
to repeat work the way they do.</p>
