Dear David,
I enjoyed your Korean tutorial.
Re http://langintro.com/kintro/bphrases/social.htm
you say you can't think of an effective quiz.
How about the following.

"Picture yourself in a restaurant.
You would like to borrow salt from the table next to you. What do you
say to get the attention of the person sitting there?

When they have passed you the salt, how do you thank them?

They reply - You're welcome.

  A waiter jogs your elbow as he walks past you, and apologises.
  What does he say to apologise?

  You answer that's all right.
