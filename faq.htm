<h1 class="question">
Will you be adding more to the tutorial?
</h1>
<div class="answer">
No, probably not. I have moved on to other interests, and frankly,
haven't kept up with my studies of Korean.  I might clean up the
HTML and make the pages look cosmetically nicer, but that's about all.
</div>
 
<h1 class="question">
So, where can I find out more about Korean?
</h1>
<div class="answer">
Go to the <a href="korlinks.htm">links</a> page.
</div>

<h1 class="question">
How can I type Korean in my word processor?
</h1>
<div class="answer">
See the
<a href="http://pantheon.yale.edu/~jshin/faq/">Hangul and Internet
in Korea FAQ</a>.
</div>

<h1 class="question">
Can you tell me how to say/write <em>fill-in-the-blank</em> in Korean?
</h1>
<div class="answer">
Sorry, no.  I am <b>not</b> a native speaker of Korean, and any answer
I give you is an educated guess at best. I'd rather not risk making
a mistake, especially when the request is preceded by, "I want to make
a gift for an important occasion for my best friend in the whole
world," or "I want to get a tattoo..."  For those names
which I have had time to do, 
<a href="namelist.html">the results are on this page</a>
</div>

<h1 class="question">
How did you get interested in Korean? / Are you Korean?
</h1>
<div class="answer">
I'm not Korean, nor have I any Korean relatives. I'm an American from
Peoria, Illinois. I did study Japanese for a time, and realized that
if I lived to be 1000 I'd never be able to learn to read and write it.
Once I found that Korean had an alphabet, I decided I'd give it a try.
I also like Korean food a lot.

<h1 class="question">
May I download your tutorial?
</h1>
<div class="answer">
Sure, go ahead. Just visit the <a href="readme.htm">download page</a>
and follow the instructions.  Then you can use the tutorial without 
needing to be connected to the internet.
If you do make a copy on your own website,
I'd appreciate knowing about it.  (Unlike Sun Myung Moon's Unification
Church, who not only made a public copy without so much as a
by-your-leave, but rewrote the introduction to make it seem as if I 
had written it for them!)
