<h1>The Korean Number Systems</h1>

<p>
That&#8217;s not a misprint above. The word <b>systems</b> is plural,
because Korean has two different sets of numbers.
</p>

<p>
One set of numbers is &#8220;pure Korean&#8221; and is used mainly for
counting. There&#8217;s a slight twist to their counting, though. You
know how we say &#8220;three sheets of paper&#8221; or  &#8220;six
bottles of soda?&#8221; Korean has similar <b>classifiers</b> to say
what kind of things they are counting, and they&#8217;re used with
nearly everything. We don&#8217;t say &#8220;three animals of
cats&#8221; or &#8220;fives things of purses,&#8220; but Korean does.
</p>

<p>
[I&#8217;m not covering the classifiers in any detail here; I&#8217;m
not competent to give a lucid or thorough explanation, and I&#8217;m
writing this section in a burning hurry as well.]
</p>

<p>
The other set of numbers is called &#8220;Sino-Korean&#8221; and is
borrowed from the Chinese numbers (or, depending upon your reading of
history, was imposed upon Korea by the Chinese). It&#8217;s used, among
other things, for expressing these concepts in numbers:
</p>

<ul>
<li>years</li>
<li>months</li>
<li>days</li>
<li>minutes</li>
<li>currency</li>
<li>phone numbers</li>
</ul>

<p>You may have noticed that hours is left out of the list. In an
absolute schizoid fit, Korean uses the pure Korean words for numbers to
count hours but uses the Sino-Korean numbers for minutes.</p>

<p>
As Pulitzer Prize-winning humorist <a
href="http://www.davebarry.com/">Dave Barry</a> would say,
&#8220;I swear I am not making this up.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
Move onward, please, to see the Pure Korean numbers in all their purity.
