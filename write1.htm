<h1>Writing Korean</h1>
<p>
The Korean alphabet is just as easy to write as it is to read.
</p>
<p>
One thing we need to know about in Korean is called <b>stroke order</b>. This
term comes from the times when Korean was written with a brush. It was 
customary to make the brushstrokes for each letter in a specific order.
</p>
<p>
It's much the same in English; when you print a capital N, you draw the lines
in this standard way.
</p>
<p>
<img src="pics/good_n.png" width="234" height="70" alt="N written correctly" />
</p>
<p>
You could get the same result with this stroke order:
</p>
<p>
<img src="pics/bad_n.png" width="234" height="71"
    alt="N written incorrectly" />
</p>
<p>
but we seriously doubt your grade school teacher would have approved,
and it just wouldn't feel right.
</p>
<p>
The next page uses Java to show you the stroke order for the Korean letters.
The general rule is that characters are written from top to bottom,
left to right.
