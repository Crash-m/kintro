<h1>Shifting Sounds (2)</h1>

<p>
People do this sort of sound shifting all the time without even being
aware of it.
In Korean, this sound shifting takes place under some very well-defined
rules. Here’s one of the more important rules:
</p>
<p>
At the beginning of a word (the <i>initial</i> position) or at the end
of a word (the <i>final</i> position), this letter:
<span class="k">ㄱ</span> 
sounds like the <b>k</b> in <b>k</b>iss.
</p>
<p>
However, when you put it between two vowels (the <i>medial</i> position),
it changes to sound like the letter <b>g</b> in <b>g</b>uess.  This is
a general rule, and there are sub-rules and exceptions, which I’m not
covering here.
(<a href="voicing.htm">See the details</a>)
</p>
<p>
This means that 
<span class="k">아기</span>
<button onclick="playSound('snd/agi');">
<img class="speaker" alt="Play" src="pics/speaker.png" />
</button>,
meaning <em>baby</em>,
is pronounced <b>a-gi</b> ,
not <span class="strike">
<b>a-ki</b>
</span>, and 
<span class="k">누구</span>
<button onclick="playSound('snd/nugu');">
<img class="speaker" alt="Play" src="pics/speaker.png" />
</button>,
meaning <em>who</em>, is
pronounced <b>nu-gu</b> .
</p>
<p>
<span class="attention">Please note:</span> The new
rules for Romanization of Korean, issued by the Korean government,
say that this letter should be written as “g” when
it appears at the beginning of a word, even though it sounds
like “k.”  Focus on the written form and the
pronunciation, not the Romanization.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>
When you get to the grammar section that covers verbs, you’ll be introduced to
another significant sound shift:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When <!-- k(p) --><span class="k">ㅂ</span>
 is followed by <!-- k(n) --><span class="k">ㄴ</span>
, the <!-- k(p) --><span class="k">ㅂ</span>
 is
pronounced like <!-- k(m) --><span class="k">ㅁ</span>
 (<strong>m</strong>), not the normal <strong>p/b</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
