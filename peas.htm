<h1>The Three Faces of P</h1>

<p>
We already know this letter: 
<span class="k">ㅂ</span>
which is pronounced pretty much the way we pronounce the letter <b>p</b>.
There&#8217;s some air behind it, but not much. It&#8217;s
romanized as <b>p</b> or <b>b</b>, depending upon its sound..
</p>
<p>
This letter, 
<span class="k">ㅍ</span>
has an extra-strength puff of
air behind it. It&#8217;s always romanized as <b>p</b>.
</p>

<div class="note">
In older versions of Korean romanization, this letter
was romanized as <b>p&#8217;</b>; now it&#8217;s just
<b>p</b>. This is why you really have to learn the alphabet, and cannot
rely on Romanization.  If you see the letter
<b>p</b> in a  Romanized word, you can&#8217;t tell if you
have a <span class="k">ㅍ</span> or
a <span class="k">ㅂ</span>.
</div>

<p>
And this letter, 
<span class="k">ㅃ</span> has no air;
it's the <b>p</b> of s<b>p</b>in.
Your throat sort of tightens up when you say it; the technical term for this is
that the letter 
<span class="k">ㅃ</span> is
<em>glottalized</em>. It is
romanized as <b>pp</b>.
