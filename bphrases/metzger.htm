<h1>Miss Metzger to the Rescue</h1>
<p>
When I studied Spanish at Pekin High School, Miss Metzger had us go over the
greeting and introductions phrases until we were sick and tired of them. Living in
central Illinois in 1968, I didn’t have many opportunities for Spanish conversation,
but I did go on to study Spanish for three and a half years, and became fairly
competent at it.
</p>
<p>
Some six years later, I was on vacation in Mexico City. I had met someone
there who was introducing me to one of his acquaintances. In Spanish, he said
something to the effect of,
&#8220;I’d like to introduce you to Juan Fulano.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
My face went totally blank as the front part of my brain began
screaming, &#8220;what do i say what do i say oh my god what do i say i
should know this what do i say?&#8221; After two or three of the
longest seconds I can remember, I felt some <em>pressure</em> at the
back of my head, heard a &#8220;click&#8221; as some long-unused
neurons fired, opened my mouth, and said as one long syllable,
&#8220;MuchoGustoEnConocerleAUsted,&#8221; the phrase I had memorized
six years earlier. It was, of course, exactly the right thing to say.
</p>
<p>
The fancy-schmancy new-age education doctorate type folks may tell you that rote
memorization is the worst way to learn anything. They might say you should never
learn anything that way. Miss Metzger and I know that isn’t always true; sometimes
those phrases you learn by rote will save the day.  Thanks, Miss Metzger!
