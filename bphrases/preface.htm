<h1>Basic Conversational Phrases</h1>
<p><a href="../index.htm">Return to main index</a></p>
<p>
Being able to read and write the Korean alphabet is nice, but if you ever find
yourself in Korea you'll have to talk to people.
The next few pages will give you
the phrases that are needed for greetings and introductions.
<br />
<span class="attention"><strong>Memorize these phrases!</strong></span>
Go over them again and again until you can respond correctly in your sleep.

<p>
If you're like most people, you might be nervous the first time you talk to
someone in a foreign language. This is perfectly natural.
You're on the high-diving board looking
down at all that water. You may be nervous. You may be self-conscious. You may
be afraid of making a mistake. I'm not going to make it worse by telling
you "don't worry." Instead, remember this: the person
you talk to will be just as understanding and forgiving as you would be if he
were talking to you in English for the first time.
