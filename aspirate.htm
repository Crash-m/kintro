<h1>Great Aspirations</h1>
<p>
Here's an experiment for you to try. Put your index finger in front of your mouth.
</p>
<p>
Say the word <big><strong>pin</strong></big>.
Now say the word <big><strong>spin</strong></big>.
</p>

<p>
Feel the difference? You probably felt a little puff of
air on the <strong>p</strong> of <strong>p</strong>in, but the
<strong>p</strong> in s<strong>p</strong>in didn't have that extra air.
</p>

<p>
[If you want to actually see the difference, take a strip of tissue paper and
hold it in front of your mouth as you repeat the experiment,
pronouncing <strong>pin</strong> and <strong>spin</strong>.]
</p>

<p>
The technical term for that little puff of air is
<strong>aspiration</strong>. In English, it doesn't make any difference
whether a consonant is aspirated or not -- most people
aren't even aware that the difference exists.
</p>

<p>
In Korean pronunciation, however, it does make a difference if a consonant is
aspirated or not. This is reflected in their alphabet.
