A1. a, eo, and i go to the right.  Any other combinations with these
vowels also go to the right.  (Yang)
o, u, and eu go to the right.  ditto for combinations. (Eum)

 Would you object to my referring to them as "vertically drawn" and
 "horizontally drawn" vowels? Then it becomes much more clear,
 at least visually - for an American - why they go where they go.
 I'll re-emphasize the fact that this is done to fit the syllable
 into a square box. The info on Yang/Eum should probably go as a
 footnote or a side page.

A2. It's called Bat-Chim (literal. 'supporting floor').

 Yes, that's a good idea to put in.

Bonus.
a, o are Yang (positive, light, light) vowels.
eo, u are Eum (negative, dark, heavy) vowels.
eu, i are neutral vowels.

Yang vowels can only be combined with another Yang vowel or neutral
vowel.  (ia, io, oa (wa), oi, a (ai), oai (wae))
 >
Eum vowels can only be combined iwth another Eum vowel or neutral
vowel.  (ieo, iu, ueo (wo), ui, e (ei), ueoi (we))
