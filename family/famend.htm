<h1>The Point System</h1>
<p>
There you have the basics of the Korean family structure.
</p>
<p>
An interesting cultural note: relationships have numeric
&#8220;points.&#8221; There are zero &#8220;points&#8221; between a
husband and wife. Between a parent and child there is one
&#8220;point&#8221; of relationship. Brothers and sisters have a
&#8220;two-point&#8221; relationship.
</p>

<p>

a total of three points (one for the parent, two for the parent&#8217;s
brother). This is reflected in the name for the unmarried paternal
uncle,
