<h1>Uncles and Aunts</h1>

<p>Things start to get interesting now. As you’ve seen before, it makes
a difference whether a relative is older or younger. It also happens
that, in Korea, the male side of the family is linguistically dominant.
I didn’t make the rules, so please <a href="http://www.now.org">don't
complain to me</a>.</p>

<p>
Not that being the eldest male child is without responsibilities&#8212;if a husband
dies, the elder brother traditionally is expected to take care of the widow and
children. In fact, that’s why the father's older brother is referred to as 
<!-- k(k'eun-@a-peo-ji) --><span class="k">큰아버지</span>
 or “big father” as you will see on the next page. 
</p>

<p>
In addition to all of this, it makes a difference (on the male side)
whether the brother is married or not. Take a deep breath and proceed
to the next page.
