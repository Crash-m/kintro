<h1>The Family</h1>
<p>The next pages talk about family relationships in Korean.
In English, things are relatively easy. We talk about <b>brothers</b> and
<b>sisters</b> as pretty much generic terms. We don&#8217;t care whether the sibling is
older or younger, or whether it&#8217;s a boy&#8217;s or girl&#8217;s sibling. A family tree
diagram can fit conveniently on a single page.
</p>
<p>
In Korean, though, these things do make a difference, and it&#8217;s reflected in the
language, giving far more significant relationships than there are in English. Trying
to draw it all on one page would produce something that looked like an
organization chart for a major multinational corporation.
</p>
<p>
So, to spare me (the &#8220;artist&#8221;) a great deal of angst and to spare
you (the reader) massive head trauma, let&#8217;s start with a picture of the
&#8220;direct relationships&#8221; in a family. </p>
