<h1>A Technical Note: Voicing</h1>

<p>
This letter:
<span class="k">ㄱ</span> 
has a sound somewhere between the English
<b>k</b> as in <b>k</b>iss and <b>g</b>
as in <b>g</b>uess.
</p>

<p>
Put your index and middle fingers on your throat and say just the
<b>k-</b> sound of the word “<b>k</b>iss.”
Now say just the hard <b>g-</b> sound of the
word “<b>g</b>uess.” Feel the vibration of your vocal cords
with the <b>g-</b>?

That vibration that you felt is called <b>voicing</b>.
We say that <b>k</b>
is an unvoiced consonant (no vibration) and <b>g</b> is a voiced
consonant (buzzzz).
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of a word (the initial position) or at the end
of a word (final position) the Korean letter <span class="k">ㄱ</span> 
sounds more like the <b>k</b> than the <b>g</b>;
it’s not voiced strongly if at all.
</p>

<p>
However, when you put it between two vowels (the medial position)
its sound is much more strongly voiced like the <b>g</b>.
</p>

<p>
Note: this is a general rule; there are exceptions and other minor
sub-rules which I’m not covering in this brief tutorial.
