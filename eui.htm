<title>Pronunciation of “ui”</title>

<h1>Pronunciation of <span class="k">ㅢ</span></h1>

<p>
This syllable, <span class="k">ㅢ</span> has absolutely
no counterpart in English.
</p>
<p>
One book says it's a “reduced schwa.”  That helps a lot, doesn’t it?!
They say to pronounce it like “uh-ee" said together quickly.
</p>
<p>
One web reference had the following formula, which I really like:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Put your lips in position to say “ee”. Your lips will be stretched horizontally
and you’ll be smiling (that’s why photographers tell you to say “cheese”).</li>
<li>Keep your lips in the “ee”  position.</li>
<li>With the rest of your mouth, say “oo”.</li>
<li>Out comes this weird sound, but it’s the one you want.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Step three is the hardest part. When you say “oo” your lips just want to spring
back to a round O shape out of habit. You may actually have to hold your lips
in place with your thumb and index finger the first few times you try this.
